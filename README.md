Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it, letter by letter. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (traditionally a hanged man) is drawn. The guesser wins by correctly identifying all the letters of the word before the drawing is complete, while the word chooser wins if the drawing is completed first.
